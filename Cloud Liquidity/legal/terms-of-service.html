Crossmint reserves the right to require you to provide additional information and documents as it believes reasonably necessary, including at the request of any competent authority or in order to assist Crossmint with complying with its obligations under applicable law, regulation, or policy, including laws related to anti-money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Crossmint may also require you to provide additional information and documents in cases where it has reason to believe that: (i) your Account is being used for money laundering or for any other illegal activity; (ii) you have concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or (iii) Transactions effected via your Account were effected in breach of this Agreement. In such cases, Crossmint, in its sole discretion, may pause or cancel your Transactions until such requested additional information and documents have been reviewed by Crossmint and accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law, regulation, or policy.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in response to such a request, or Crossmint is otherwise unable to verify your identity, or we have actual indications of fraud or violation of applicable legislation or regulation from your side, Crossmint may, in its sole discretion:</p><ol role="list"><li>suspend your account temporarily while we investigate further</li><li>reverse or rescind any NFT purchase Transaction that it reasonably suspects has been conducted in violation of applicable law, fraud or this Agreement;</li><li>refuse to provide any NFT, Content, product, service and/or further access to the Service to you; and/or</li><li>if no other remedy is available and you have not complied with our requests to verify your compliance with applicable legislation, terminate your Account;</li></ol><p>all without no compensation whatsoever for you.</p><p>‍</p><p>In the latter (iv) above (this is, if no other remedy is available when you have not complied with applicable legislation, and, in response, we terminate your account), you hereby acknowledge and accept that any NFT left behind in your Crossmint Wallet shall be repossessed by Crossmint, and thus you hereby waive any right you may have over such NFT(s) and any legal action to claim back ownership or any other right over the abovementioned NFT(s).</p><p>Additionally, Crossmint will also be entitled to repossess any NFT(s) that have been minted through transactions where a refund has been successfully processed in favor of the user or where, after the corresponding dispute proceeding has finalized, it has been deemed that such NFT is the property of Crossmint or (for whatever reason,</p><p>such as being the result of an erroneous transaction) there is no ownership title whatsoever.</p><p>‍</p><p>By creating an Account, you consent to receive electronic communications from Crossmint (e.g., via email or by posting notices to the Service). These communications may include notices about your Account (e.g., password changes and other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including, but not limited to, that such communications be in writing. You should maintain copies of electronic communications from us by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. We have no obligation to store for your later use or access any such electronic communications that we make to you. We may also send you promotional communications via email, including, but not limited to, newsletters, special offers, surveys and other news and information we think will be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving these promotional emails at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided therein.</p><p>‍</p><p>When you register for an Account, you hereby represent and warrant, to and for the benefit of Crossmint, its affiliates and its and their respective representatives, as follows:</p><p>‍</p><p>Accuracy of Personal Information. All information provided to Crossmint and/or its third-party designees, including address and social security number or tax ID number, is accurate and complete. None of: (i) you; (ii) any of your affiliates; (iii) any other person having a beneficial interest in you; or (iv) any person for whom you are acting as agent or nominee in connection with this Agreement is: (A) a country, territory, entity or individual named on an OFAC list as provided at<a href="http://www.treas.gov/ofac"> http://www.treas.gov/ofac,</a> or a person or entity prohibited under the OFAC programs, regardless of whether or not they appear on the OFAC list; or (B) a senior foreign political figure, or any immediate family member or close associate of a senior foreign political figure; or (C) a national or resident of any jurisdiction subject to a U.S. trade embargo</p><p>‍</p><p>Independent Investigation and Non-Reliance. You are sophisticated, experienced and knowledgeable in the buying, selling or trading of NFTs, as applicable. Additionally, you have conducted an independent investigation of the Service and the matters contemplated by this Agreement, have formed your own independent judgment regarding the benefits and risks of and necessary and desirable practices regarding the foregoing, and, in making the determination to buy, sell or trade any</p><p>NFTs using the Service, you have relied solely on the results of such investigation and such independent judgement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you understand, acknowledge and agree that the legal requirements pertaining to blockchain technologies and digital assets and digital goods generally, including the NFTs, are uncertain, and you have conducted an independent investigation of such potentially applicable legal requirements and the resulting risks and uncertainties, including the risk that one or more governmental entities or other persons may assert that any digital assets or cryptographic tokens (including the NFTs) may constitute securities under applicable legal requirements. You hereby irrevocably disclaim and disavow reliance upon any statements or representations made by or on behalf of, or information made available by, Crossmint, in determining to enter into this Agreement or to buy, sell or trade any NFTs or otherwise use the Service.</p><p>‍</p><p>Litigation. There is no legal proceeding pending that relates to your activities relating to NFTs, other digital assets, or blockchain technology.</p><p>‍</p><p>Compliance. You have not failed to comply with, and have not violated, any applicable legal requirement relating to any blockchain technologies, token trading activities or NFT purchase and/or sale. No investigation or review by any governmental entity is pending or, to your knowledge, has been threatened against or with respect to you, nor does any government order or action prohibit you or any of your representatives from engaging in or continuing any conduct, activity or practice relating to NFTs.</p><p>‍</p><p>You must provide all equipment and software necessary to connect to the Service. You are solely responsible for any fees, including Internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur when accessing the Service.</p><p>‍<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>3. Purchasing an NFT</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>In order to purchase an NFT using the Service, you must provide a valid and accepted payment method, such as your credit card (your “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”). Upon Crossmint’s authorization and verification of your Payment Method(s), you will be able to engage in Transactions. You are responsible for keeping all information for your Payment Method updated and accurate through the term of this Agreement.</p><p>‍</p><p>Users who have registered for an Account (each, a “<strong>Registered User</strong>”) and have provided a valid Payment Method to Crossmint can use the Payment Method to purchase an NFT being offered for sale by Crossmint or by an Original Offeror,</p><p>including without limitation (i) an Original Offeror that has integrated the Service into its platform; and (ii) an Original Offeror offering an NFT that they own for sale through a third-party platform that has integrated the Service into its platform. All pricing for such NFTs is set by the seller of such NFTs and listed at point of sale or otherwise through the platform on which such seller makes such NFTs available for purchase.</p><p>‍</p><p>When you use the Service to purchase an NFT offered for sale by an Original Offeror, you agree and understand that Crossmint will (i) purchase such NFT and take custody of such NFT, and (ii) settle the Transaction with you by charging or debiting your chosen payment method and delivering to your Crossmint Wallet the NFT you have purchased from Crossmint. Once Crossmint completes the purchase of the NFT from the Original Offeror, Crossmint settles with the Original Offeror via payment in cryptocurrency or fiat currency, as applicable.</p><p>‍</p><p>Crossmint will facilitate the transfer of any NFT you purchase using the Service to your Crossmint Wallet as soon as funds have settled to Crossmint, or earlier in Crossmint’s sole discretion. This settlement of funds to Crossmint, and in turn the transfer of the NFT from Crossmint to your Crossmint Wallet, may take up to three business days but in some cases may be longer. Crossmint is not responsible for any delays related to such transfer and/or any damage this may cause you, if any. Crossmint may also require you to provide additional information and documents in connection with a Transaction where it has reasons to believe that: (i) your Account is being used for money laundering or for any other illegal activity; (ii) you have concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or (iii) Transactions effected via your Account were effected in breach of this Agreement. In such cases, Crossmint, in its sole discretion, may pause or cancel such Transaction until such requested additional information and documents have been reviewed by Crossmint and accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law, regulation, or policy. If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in response to such a request, or Crossmint is otherwise unable to verify your identity, Crossmint may, in its sole discretion, (A) reverse or rescind any NFT purchase Transaction that it reasonably suspects has been conducted in violation of applicable law or this Agreement; and/or (B) refuse to provide any NFT, Content, product, service and/or further access to the Service to you.</p><p>‍</p><p>If Crossmint cannot complete your Transaction for any reason (including price movement, market latency, or order size), Crossmint will reject the order and notify you of such rejection. In the event a Transaction cannot be completed, (i) If your card has not been charged, Crossmint will authorize a release of any hold on your</p><p>card in connection with a rejected order; and (ii) if your card has already been charged, Crossmint will initiate a refund to your card. You will not be irrevocably charged for a rejected Transaction unless it is due to your breach of this Agreement or agreement with the provider of your Payment Method, or otherwise as set forth in Section 6, below.</p><p>‍</p><p>When you choose to purchase an NFT through the Service using a cryptocurrency, we will request the applicable cryptocurrency funds from your wallet before we buy the NFT. If Crossmint’s buying transaction fails, and you are entitled to a refund as addressed in the immediately preceding paragraph, you acknowledge and agree that</p><p>(i) you may be liable for gas fees and other transaction costs in connection with such refund; and (ii) at our sole discretion, we may provide such refund in an equivalent value in a different cryptocurrency from the one in which you originally funded the purchase.</p><p>‍</p><p>In the event that you are entitled to a refund in connection with a cryptocurrency purchase of an NFT, you will be asked to enter a valid third-party digital wallet address through the Service. You represent and warrant that you are the owner of the wallet that you provide. You are solely responsible for ensuring that the wallet address is correct and that the wallet supports the cryptocurrency in which the refund will be processed. All such refund payments are non-cancellable and irreversible.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>4. Your Crossmint Wallet</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Your Crossmint Wallet is linked to your Account and may include multiple discrete digital wallets, each supporting a different blockchain, but collectively visible to you through the Service as a single digital wallet. Once an NFT is transferred to your Crossmint Wallet, you can log into your Account on the Site to access, view, and display through such Crossmint Wallet NFTs that (i) you have purchased using the Service; or (ii) you have purchased outside the Service and transferred to such Crossmint Wallet. Crossmint does not represent that your Crossmint Wallet or any NFTs stored therein will be interoperable with any specific third-party platform or service, or that you will be able to access and/or redeem any benefits embedded in or otherwise connected to an NFT (such as, for example, token-gated access to a third-party service) while such NFT is in your Crossmint Wallet.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you wish to withdraw an NFT from your Crossmint Wallet to a third-party digital wallet, you must submit a request to Crossmint. Crossmint will make commercially reasonable efforts to effect all such withdrawals within a reasonable period of time. You may be liable for gas fees and other transaction costs in connection with such</p><p>withdrawal. Crossmint shall have no liability to you in connection with any loss or error arising from or in connection with any incorrect information (including, for e.g., third-party digital wallet address) provided by you in connection with any such withdrawal.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>5. Pricing; Payment</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Any payment obligations you incur are binding at the time of purchase. You may not substitute any other currency, whether cryptocurrency or fiat currency, for the currency in which you have contracted to pay at the time of purchase. For clarity, no fluctuation in the value of any currency, whether cryptocurrency or otherwise, shall impact or excuse your obligations with respect to any purchase.</p><p>‍</p><p>All pricing and fees will be set forth at the time and point of sale. By using the Service you agree to pay all applicable fees. Crossmint reserves the right to adjust its pricing and fees at any time. We will notify you of the pricing and fees which apply to your Transaction when you authorize the Transaction and in each receipt we issue to you. Our fee may include gas fees to process a Transaction, which we will calculate in our discretion. We will notify you of the total amount of your purchase at or before the time you authorize the Transaction. You are responsible for paying any additional fees charged by your financial services provider. In the event that we receive a payment in an amount less than the total due for the relevant Transaction, we will reject the order, notify you of the reason for the rejection, and (except where otherwise required to comply with applicable law) return the payment less our processing costs. You may be responsible for additional transaction fees, including gas fees, in connection with your Transaction.</p><p>‍</p><p>When a Transaction is initiated through your Account, we will assume that you authorized such Transaction, unless you notify us otherwise. If you believe you did not authorize a particular Transaction or that a Transaction was incorrectly carried out, you must contact us as soon as possible. While we endeavor to assist with unauthorized or erroneous Transactions, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to reverse or correct any Transaction once it has been initiated.</p><p>‍</p><p>You cannot cancel, reverse or change any Transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful, if your Payment Method has insufficient funds or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize Crossmint, in its sole discretion, to either cancel the Transaction or to debit your any of your other Payment Methods in any amount necessary to complete the</p><p>Transaction on its original terms. You agree to make any such payment upon Crossmint’s request. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, non-sufficient funds (NSF) or similar fees charged by your financial services provider. We reserve the right to refuse to process or to cancel or reverse any Transaction in our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your Payment Method(s), if we suspect the Transaction violates this Agreement. In such instances, Crossmint will reverse the Transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or under the same terms as the cancelled Transaction.</p><p>‍</p><p>Crossmint may use a third-party payment processor to process any payment you make to Crossmint. Crossmint may add or change any payment processing services at any time. Such services may be subject to additional terms or conditions. Whether a particular currency or cryptocurrency is accepted as a payment method by Crossmint is in Crossmint’s sole discretion and subject to change at any time.</p><p>‍</p><p>Crossmint may from time to time make available certain conditional offers, promotional prices, or discounted fees (each, a “<strong>Promotion</strong>”) to new or existing users of the Service. The rules governing such Promotion will be made available in connection with such Promotion. Crossmint will determine your eligibility for any Promotion in its sole discretion and may change the terms of or terminate a Promotion at any time, with or without notice to you.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>6.

W.J. Howey Co, 328 U.S. 293 (1946) so that the NFTs are not considered securities under any circumstances.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>10.

Dispute Resolution; Arbitration.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Please read the arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p><p>‍</p><p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Service, to any products sold or distributed through the Service, to any NFTs, or to any aspect of your relationship with Crossmint, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (ii) you or Crossmint may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</p><p>‍</p><p>Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to us at support@Crossmint.io. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/%3B"> http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/;</a> all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/"> http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.</a> JAMS’s rules are also available at<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/"> www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800- 352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Crossmint will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on</p><p>written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>‍</p><p>Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p><p>‍</p><p>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND CROSSMINT HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND</p><p>HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.a (Application of Arbitration Agreement) above.
